\paragraph{} 
We can compute very easily the probability of one dice to win against an other one just by looking at all 36 possibilities. The results are :
\begin{itemize}
\item A wins C with probability 20/36
\item C wins B with probability 20/36
\item B wins A with probability 20/36
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
This shows that Alice can always pick a dice which will win with probability 20/36 ($>$1/2) against the one Bob picked.
