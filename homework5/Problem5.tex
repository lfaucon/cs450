Let's use here the maxflow-mincut theorem to be able to reasonne on a minimal cut instead of a flow. Let's consider we have a minimal cut for our problem, this cut is of value $F$. We denote for now on our cut by $\mathcal{C}$ and its cardinality (i.e. the number of edges in the cut by $\mathcal{C}$
