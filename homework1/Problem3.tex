\paragraph{}
Let's consider this problem in a high and theoritical point of view. We know that we have a priority queue that supports insert and delete-min in $O(log(n))$ worst-case execution time. This means that :
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\exists \alpha$ such that the real execution time of insert is always less than $\alpha log(n)$
	\item $\exists \beta$ such that the real execution time of delete-min is always less than $\beta log(n)$
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{}
The main idea is that if we begin with an initially empty tree, there will always be more insert than delete-min. Therefore we can design a potential function that makes the amortized cost of insert a little bit higher (but in the same asymptotic class) and makes the amortized cost of delete-min constant.
\paragraph{}
Let's call $n$ the total number of nodes in the tree. We are now able to define our potential function $\Phi(n)$ :
for $ n > 0, \Phi(n) = \beta \times \sum_{\substack{0<k\leqslant n \\}}log(k)   $ ; $ \Phi(0) = 0 $ (by convention)

\paragraph{}
Let's compute the sum of the real cost and the potential variation of the two operations insert and delete-min.

\paragraph{For insert :}
\paragraph{}
$real cost + \Delta\Phi \leqslant \alpha log(n) + \beta(log(n+1))$

\paragraph{}
Therefore, $real cost + \Delta\Phi \leqslant O(log(n))$, the amortized cost of insert is less than $log(n)$.

\paragraph{For delete-min  :}
\paragraph{}
$real cost + \Delta\Phi \leqslant \beta log(n) - \beta log(n) =  0$

\paragraph{}
Thus, the amortized time of delete-min operation is $O(1)$.
