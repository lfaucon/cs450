\paragraph{}
After 15 pushes followed by 7 pops the stack will be in the following state :

\begin{tabular}{rl}
$S_0$ & 8 \\
$S_1$ & 7 \\
$S_2$ & 6 5 \\
$S_3$ & 4 3 2 1 \\
\end{tabular}


\paragraph{2.} 
\paragraph{}
The worst case scenario for pop is for any given integer k when $S_0$ contains one element and for i from 1 to k $S_i$ is half full. In that state a pop will empty $S_0$ which will then take elements from $S_1$ emptying it in the process. $S_1$ will then take elements from $S_2$ emptying it in the process. This so empties every $S_i$ until the last one resulting in a number of operation equal to the number of elements in the stack.
\paragraph{}
The worst case for push is for any given integer k when for i from 0 to k $S_i$ is completely full. In that state pushing an element in the stack will overload $S_0$ which will then push its elements on $S_1$ overloading it in the process. $S_1$ will then push its elements on $S_2$ overloading it in the process. This so overloads every $S_i$ until the last one resulting in a number of operation equal to the number of elements in the stack.
\paragraph{}
The worst case scenario for pop and push are both in linear $O(n)$ time.


\paragraph{3.} 
\paragraph{}
Let $k$ be any integer and $n=2^k-1$. 

\paragraph{Initial state : } Empty stack
\paragraph{Operation sequence : }
\begin{itemize}
\item{}n pushes
\item{}n pops
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
Since the $k-1$ first stacks can contain at  most $2^{k-1}-1$ elements, we are sure that at least $2^{k-1}$ elements went at least in the $k$-th stack. However it takes one operation to move one element from one stack to the next, so these $2^{k-1}$ elements required $k \times 2^{k-1} = O(nlog(n))$ operations. This grows faster than the length of the sequence.
